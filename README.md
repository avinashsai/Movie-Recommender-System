# Movie-Recommender-System

This  repository is about the movie recommender system

Data set:

The data set consists of 1630 users with more than 930 movies

Each movie has 19 features

The data set contains user rated each movie and the features of the movie represented as 0's and 1's

1 represent movie is of the feature type whereas 0 represents movie is not

Approach:

Using Kmeans Clustering and Pearson correlation Similarity the users who has similar interests are identified and movies are 

recommended to the users


Test Data:

It consists of 9300 test examples.

Algorithm acheived mean squared error of 1.24154447389

optimising mean squared error:

mean squared error for n_clusters =2 is 1.08155166095
This is the most optimised algorithm so far.
